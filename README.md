## About this Repo

This repository is a place for me to demonstrate the style I like to use in my playwright tests, tricks I like to use and new things I'm trying to learn. I intent for this is not just demonstrate that I can automate in playwright but that I understand how to build a framework (including reporting, CI, etc)
