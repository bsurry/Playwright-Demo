## About this Repo

This repository demonstrates my approach to writing Playwright tests, highlighting techniques I use, tricks I find helpful, and new concepts I'm exploring. It is designed to demonstrate my ability to automate with Playwright but also to illustrate my understanding of building a complete testing framework, including reporting, continuous integration, and more.
